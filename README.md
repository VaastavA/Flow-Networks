# Flow Networks
A collection of constraint based problems that are solvable by flow networks of different nature. 
A flow network is a directed graph where each edge has a capacity and each edge receives a flow such that the amount of flow on an edge cannot exceed the capacity of the edge. Flow networks obey the law of conservation of flow and max-flow min-cut equivalence theorem. Nodes, their interconnections and capacities of these interconnections can be used to represent a wide variatey contraints in a certain problem that can then be solved by chiefly using the two tools mentioned above.
